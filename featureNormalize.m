function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X 
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

    X_norm = X;
    mu = zeros(1, size(X, 2));
    sigma = zeros(1, size(X, 2));

    for i=1:size(X,2)   
        mu(i) = mean(X(:,i));
        sigma(i) = std(X(:,i));    
    end

    X_norm = (X - mu)./sigma;
